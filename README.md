This program visualizes web page dependencies and draws a graph of these dependencies. This visualization can help when searching for plagiarism. For security reasons, the siteâ€™s functionality is limited to accessible domains.

## Restrictions:

Allowed domain list: `[ ".wikipedia.org"]`<br>
Max graph depth size: `3`


## Try it NOW!

## Run locally

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  If you downloaded this project from <http://www.playframework.com/download> then you'll find a prepackaged version of sbt in the project directory:

```bash
sbt run
```

And then go to <http://localhost:9000> to see the running web application.

There are several demonstration files available in this template.
